This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my bachelor thesis in mathematics, which is titled "Efficient Succinct Data Structures for Directed Acyclic Graphs". The thesis was submitted to the University of Pisa in May 2025. The supervisor was Prof. Roberto Grossi.

The template is Classic Thesis by André Miede. The template is available at [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/classicthesis?lang=en). It's an elegant layout designed in homage to Bringhurst’s “The Elements of Typographic Style”.

## Structure and Building

There are two main folders in the repository:

- `thesis`: contains the LaTeX source code for the thesis
- `slides`: contains the LaTeX source code for the presentation slides

There is a GitHub Action that compiles both the thesis and the slides at every push to the repository. The compiled PDFs are available at the following:

- **Thesis PDF:** [view](https://github.com/lukefleed/bachelor-thesis/blob/build/main.pdf) | [download](https://github.com/lukefleed/bachelor-thesis/raw/build/main.pdf)
- **Slides PDF:** [view](https://github.com/lukefleed/bachelor-thesis/blob/build/thesis_slides.pdf) | [download](https://github.com/lukefleed/bachelor-thesis/raw/build/thesis_slides.pdf)

Otherwise, you can compile locally using `texlive`
