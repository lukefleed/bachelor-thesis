This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my bachelor thesis in mathematics, which is titled "Efficient Succinct Data Structures for Directed Acyclic Graphs". The thesis was submitted to the University of Pisa in May 2025. The supervisor was Prof. Roberto Grossi.

The template is Classic Thesis by André Miede. The template is available at [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/classicthesis?lang=en). It's an elegant layout designed in homage to Bringhurst’s “The Elements of Typographic Style”.

## Building the project

There is a Github Action that compiles the LaTeX project at every push to the repository. The compiled PDF is available at the following: [view](https://github.com/lukefleed/bachelor-thesis/blob/build/main.pdf) | [download](https://github.com/lukefleed/bachelor-thesis/raw/build/main.pdf)

Otherwise, you can compile locally using `texlive`
