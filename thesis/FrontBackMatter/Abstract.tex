\chapter*{Abstract}
This work introduces a redefinition of the classic rank query, traditionally applied to bitvectors and strings, for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). We present a novel succinct data structure that leverages the topology of the input DAG to efficiently support these generalized queries while maintaining space usage below the entropy of the original graph (as there is no need to keep the whole graph to answer the queries). Our approach targets node-weighted DAGs and incorporates a critical algorithmic component: solving a generalized prefix-sum problem along DAG paths. These prefix sums, computed recursively from the root, encapsulate essential meta-information that underpins the succinct representation. The outcome of a query is expressed as a collection of ranges \([l, r]\), each representing a contiguous span of values reachable from the queried node. These ranges capture all possible accumulations (sums) of information derived from paths that originate at the source of the DAG and end at the queried node.
