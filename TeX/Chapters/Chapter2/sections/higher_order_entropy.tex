\section{Higher Order Entropy}
TODO: I still have to decide what to write, maybe just an introduction from \cite{navarro2016compact} and then talk (just one paragraph) about Lampel-Ziv algorithms \cite{ziv1977universal} and the fact that they are asymptotically optimal for higher order entropy \cite{wyner1994sliding}. \\

\noindent There are other examples like adaptive probability models, which are for example used in video encoding, but maybe I should not go into too much detail about this, TBD
