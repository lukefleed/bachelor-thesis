\section{Compressed Wavelet Trees}
TODO: An introduction on why we need to compress wavelet trees. From \cite{navarro2016compact} 6.2.4

\subsection{Entropy Coding}
Compressing the bitvectors, from \cite{WTForALL} 3.1 and \cite{navarro2016compact} 6.2.4

\subsection{Huffman-Shaped Wavelet Trees}
TODO: An alternative to obtain nearly zero-order compressed space while using plain bitvectors is to
give a Huffman shape to the wavelet tree, instead of using a balanced tree of height $\log \sigma$. From \cite{navarro2016compact} 6.2.4, \cite{WTForALL} 3.2

\subsection{Higher Order Entropy Coding}
TODO: In 3.3 from \cite{WTForALL} there is a good explanation on how to compress the bitvectors using higher-order entropy coding. It references papers as \cite{grossi2004indexing}. There is also section 5 from \cite{TheMyriadVirtuesWT} that gives a more technical explanation
