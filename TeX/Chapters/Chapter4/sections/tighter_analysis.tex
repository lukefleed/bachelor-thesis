\section{A tighter analysis on space occupancy}
Alanko et al. in \cite{SubsetWT} leave the following problem open:
\begin{quote}
    The main open problem we leave is to find a tighter analysis of the space required by subset wavelet trees when entropy compression is applied to their node sequences. In particular, can the size of the resulting structure be related in some way to the entropy of the subset sequence
