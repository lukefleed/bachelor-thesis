\chapter*{Abstract}
In this thesis, we introduce a novel approach to constructing succinct data structures for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), with particular emphasis on optimizing query performance. Our research centers on redefining the conventional rank query, typically employed in bitvector contexts, for DAGs. We focus on a specialized class of DAGs where to each node is associated a string composed of characters drawn from a fixed alphabet, $\Sigma$. We begin by partitioning the original DAG into $|\Sigma|$ distinct DAGs, each corresponding to a character in the alphabet. Within these character-specific DAGs, nodes store the count of occurrences of the respective character in the string associated with each node. We then propose a succinct representation of these DAGs, specifically engineered to solve rank queries. Our proposed rank query takes a node and a character as input and efficiently returns a range $\langle l, r \rangle$. This range represents the minimum and maximum possible occurrences of the character along all paths originating from the root node to the specified node within the DAG.
